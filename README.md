A curated list of awesome Bioimage Analysis Challenges. The goal of this list is to be a place where Bioimage Analysis Developers can find challenges to evaluate and benchmark their algorithms. In order to be added the linked challenge should have:

- imaging data available for public download
- a specified image analysis task (e.g. segmentation, classification)
- a metric for evaluating performance
- some form of "annotation", "labeling", or "ground truth"

This is list currently organized by scientific domain.
